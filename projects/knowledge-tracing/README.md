## The Knowledge Tracing (KT) Analyst

**Objective:** Build a model that tracks a student's "Internal Knowledge State" based on conversational transcripts.

### Tech Stack

* **Methodology:** **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** first, then **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**.
* **Data:** Synthetic transcripts generated by two LLMs (one acting as a "struggling student," one as a "tutor").
* **Tracing Framework:** Use a **Stateful Agent (LangGraph)** to maintain a "Knowledge Map" (a JSON object of concepts like `recursion: 0.8`, `pointers: 0.2`).

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Generation:** Use GPT-4 to generate transcripts where a student tries to solve a LeetCode problem. The transcript should include the student's incorrect code and the tutor's hints.
2. **Labeling:** Create labels that say: *"At this point in the chat, the student has mastered 'loops' but is confused about 'index out of bounds'."*
3. **Fine-tuning:** Train your model to output this "Knowledge Trace" JSON after reading a segment of text.
4. **RL Alignment (DPO):** If the model over-estimates a student's skill (bad), vs. correctly identifying a gap (good), use DPO to prefer the accurate diagnosis.
5. **Skills Gained:** RLHF/DPO, Agentic State Management, Educational AI (EdTech) logic.
