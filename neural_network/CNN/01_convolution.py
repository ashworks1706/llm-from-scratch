# convolutional operations from scratch
# the core operation that makes cnns work for images

# topics to cover:
# - what is a convolution (sliding window with kernel)
# - kernel filters and feature detection
# - stride and padding
# - input channels and output channels
# - weight sharing across spatial dimensions
# - why convolutions work for images (local patterns, translation invariance)
# - implementing conv2d forward pass
