# tensor operations, shapes, and broadcasting
# tensors are the fundamental data structure in pytorch
# understanding tensor operations is crucial for everything else

# topics to cover:
# - creating tensors (zeros, ones, random, from data)
# - tensor shapes and dimensions
# - indexing and slicing
# - reshape, view, transpose
# - broadcasting rules
# - element wise operations
# - matrix multiplication vs element wise multiply
# - tensor methods (sum, mean, max, etc)
