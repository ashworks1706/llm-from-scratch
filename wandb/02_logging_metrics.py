# logging training metrics and loss curves
# tracking what matters during training

# topics to cover:
# - wandb.log() for scalars (loss, accuracy, lr)
# - step parameter for x axis
# - logging frequency (every step vs every epoch)
# - multiple metrics in one call
# - custom x axis with define_metric()
# - loss curves and smoothing
# - comparing metrics across runs
# - when to log (training vs validation)

# OBJECTIVE: log training loop metrics and visualize loss curves
# compare multiple training runs side by side
