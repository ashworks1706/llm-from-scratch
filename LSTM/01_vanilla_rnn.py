# vanilla rnn cell from scratch
# the simplest recurrent architecture

# topics to cover:
# - recurrent connections (hidden state fed back)
# - processing sequences one step at a time
# - hidden state as memory
# - forward pass through time
# - vanishing gradient problem
# - why vanilla rnns struggle with long sequences
