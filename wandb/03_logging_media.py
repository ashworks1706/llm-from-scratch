# logging images, text, and model outputs
# visualizing what model learns beyond numbers

# topics to cover:
# - wandb.Image() for logging images
# - wandb.Table() for structured data
# - wandb.Html() for rich formatting
# - logging generated text samples
# - attention weight visualizations
# - embedding projections with wandb.plot
# - histograms of activations and gradients
# - logging frequency for media (expensive)

# OBJECTIVE: log model generations and attention patterns
# visualize training progress beyond loss curves
