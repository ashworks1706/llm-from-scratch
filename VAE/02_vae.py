# variational autoencoder from scratch
# generative model with probabilistic latent space

# topics to cover:
# - probabilistic encoder (mean and log variance)
# - reparameterization trick
# - kl divergence loss
# - reconstruction loss plus kl loss
# - sampling from latent space
# - why vae generates better than autoencoder
