# pooling operations from scratch
# downsampling to reduce spatial dimensions

# topics to cover:
# - max pooling vs average pooling
# - why pooling (dimension reduction, translation invariance)
# - pooling window size and stride
# - implementing maxpool2d and avgpool2d
# - global average pooling
# - effect on gradient flow
