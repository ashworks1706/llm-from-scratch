# residual connections from scratch
# the innovation that enabled very deep networks

# topics to cover:
# - vanishing gradient problem in deep networks
# - skip connections (residual connections)
# - identity mapping
# - why residuals help training
# - implementing a residual block
# - connection to transformers (they also use residual connections)
