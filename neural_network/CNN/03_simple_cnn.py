# simple cnn for mnist classification
# putting conv and pooling together

# topics to cover:
# - cnn architecture (conv -> relu -> pool -> conv -> relu -> pool -> fc)
# - feature extraction vs classification layers
# - flattening before fully connected layers
# - training on mnist dataset
# - visualizing learned filters
# - comparing to fully connected network
