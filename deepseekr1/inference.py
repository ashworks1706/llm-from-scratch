# Inference optimization for thinking and output generation
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Implement KV cache to avoid recomputing attention
# - Generate thinking tokens with sampling for diversity
# - Apply early stopping if confidence is high
# - Support batch generation for multiple prompts
# - Stream tokens in real-time during inference
