# tracking datasets and model checkpoints
# versioning and lineage for reproducibility

# topics to cover:
# - wandb.Artifact() for creating artifacts
# - artifact types (dataset, model, predictions)
# - artifact versioning (v0, v1, v2, ...)
# - logging artifacts with run.log_artifact()
# - downloading artifacts with run.use_artifact()
# - artifact lineage (which model trained on which data)
# - storage and caching
# - when to use artifacts vs regular files

# OBJECTIVE: track model checkpoints across training runs
# understand dataset versioning and lineage
