# loss functions from scratch
# measures how wrong the model predictions are

# topics to cover:
# - mean squared error (regression)
# - cross entropy (classification)
# - binary cross entropy
# - why cross entropy for classification not mse
# - numerical stability issues
# - reduction methods (mean, sum, none)
