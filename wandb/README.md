weights and biases for experiment tracking and visualization. essential for comparing training runs and debugging training dynamics.

training deep learning models requires tracking dozens of metrics across hundreds of experiments. wandb provides centralized experiment tracking with rich visualizations.

initialization covers project setup and run configuration. understanding how to organize experiments and log hyperparameters for comparing runs.

logging tracks metrics during training. covers scalar logging, custom charts, logging frequency and understanding what metrics matter for debugging.

media logging captures model outputs. covers images, text, tables and audio to visualize what model learns beyond loss curves.

artifacts track datasets and models. covers versioning, lineage tracking and managing model checkpoints across experiments.

sweeps automate hyperparameter search. covers grid search, random search and bayesian optimization to find best hyperparameters efficiently.

integrations work with existing code. covers pytorch lightning, huggingface trainer and custom training loops.
