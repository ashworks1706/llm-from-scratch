# RL training loop with PPO or GRPO
#
# LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
# - Generate thinking and answer sequences on-policy
# - Compute rewards from learned reward model
# - Estimate advantages for policy updates
# - Apply policy gradient with clipping or preference loss
# - Balance reward maximization with KL constraint to SFT baseline
