# lstm cell implementation from scratch
# long short term memory with gating mechanisms

# topics to cover:
# - three gates (forget, input, output)
# - cell state vs hidden state
# - forget gate (what to forget from memory)
# - input gate (what new info to add)
# - output gate (what to output)
# - gate equations and sigmoid activations
# - how gates solve vanishing gradients
# - step by step forward pass
